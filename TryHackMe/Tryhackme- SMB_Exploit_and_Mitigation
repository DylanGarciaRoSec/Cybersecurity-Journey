# Networking Services / SMB Walkthrough

## Objective:
Demonstrate how attackers gain unauthorized access to a machine exploiting SMB and how defenders can understand, mitigate, and prevent such risks.

## Tools Used
* nmap - Network scanning and service enumeration
* enum4linux - SMB enumeration
* SMBclient - Accessing SMB shares
* ssh - Secure shell access using a private key)=
* chmod - Adjusting file permissions

## Enumerating SMB
1. ran a service/version detection nmap scan with aggressive timing
* 'nmap -A -T4 -Pn [TARGET_IP]' and found open SMB port 139/445
2. conducted a full basic enumeration using 'enum4linux -a' and revealed smb share "profiles"

## Exploiting SMB
1. used the following SMBclient syntax to acess "profiles" smb share on port 139/445, leading to a shell
* smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE] -U [USERNAME] -p 139/445
2. once inside the share, listed the directory and found document that gave information regarding services that configured the target to work from home (SSH).
3. Looked into the ssh directory and found authentication keys (id_rsa) that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access a server
4. Downloaded id_rsa file, and changed permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]" to fix private key permissions.
5. Displayed id_rsa file and found username of the account (cactus).
6. After obtaining the private key (id_rsa), I used the following command to gain SSH access to the target machine:
* ssh -i id_rsa cactus@[IP]

## Conclusion
Successfully exploited misconfigured network service SMB by gaining unauthorized access to important smb share via SSH using a leaked private key. This challenges shows the importance of securing file shares, restricting anonymous access, and properly managing key file permissions.

## Prevention
* Restrict SMB services to trusted hosts only.
* Enforce authentication by never allowing anonymous or guest access to sensitive shares
* Protect SSH keys by avoiding storing private keys onto shared folder, and enforce stronger access controls with principles of least privilege.

## Skills demonstrated
enumeration, SMB exploitation, key-based SSH access, permission handling.
